# Magic Storage

Are you tired of having a mess of chests in your base? Never remember where you put your items, and have to run across your entire house to get from chest to chest? This mod will solve all of your problems!

This mod offers a solution to storage problems once and for all. It allows you to construct a central network to store all your items, that you can access from one single block. If desired, you can even set up multiple access points to use your storage from anywhere in the world. You can search your storage for items with a certain name, filter by item types, etc. The magic storage can even craft items for you!

The magic storage scales as you progress in your playthrough. It is accessible very early in the game, but with limited power. As you defeat bosses and earn more materials, you will be able to upgrade your storage to perform more functions and more easily expand the storage capacity.

## What this fork is

I decided to improve a bit on things I didn't really quite like in the original mod.

For example you can no longer place stations in the crafting interface (this seemed strange and not Terraria-like),
now can now craft directly from storage (as long as you are next to the required station and have the interface opened).

Restock and quick stack button. Also "quick stack to nearby chests" looks for storage access points.

Another thing I didn't like was the UI. It was too futuristic/mechanical and not really "magic". I tried to improve it and this is the result:

## TODO
* It's annoying to have to rely on HarmonyLib to do IL hooking. I think using the intended way caused a crash because the method I was patching was too big (DrawInventory).
